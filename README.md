# Giant Squid

You might be inclined to think this is about the animal, but sorry to disappoint you (you won't be), this is about the game studio.

## Background

Giant Squid Studios is the spiritual successor to [thatgamecompany](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thatgamecompany), the team behind critically acclaimed games like,

* *Flow* (2006)
* *Flower* (2009)
* *Journey* (2012)

The games are known for being short single-player experiences with low stakes, beautiful art, and world-class music, making for a great way to spend a Sunday afternoon.

The stories are often ambiguous, typically about lost civilizations, with very little (or sometimes none at all) text to guide the reader, relying on environmental storytelling. The games give the player the pieces of the puzzle through wall carvings, tapestries, and architecture, allowing them to craft their own understanding of the story.

thatgamecompany eventually had a management shift, with many of the lead developers and artists forming Giant Squid Studios.

## The Beginning

Even though [*Journey*](https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP9000-CUSA00694_00-JOURNEYPS4061115) was technically created by thatgamecompany, Giant Squid kept the same kind of gameplay loop and art direction (including the composer, Austin Wintory) in their subsequent games.

In *Journey*, you take control of a mysterious star-fallen crimson-clad traveler. Around you, an endless sandy mirage. In the distance you see a towering olympus, its summit split by a grand light piercing the sky. You know only one thing: I must get to the mountain top.

As you journey across the sands, you find you're surrounded by the graves of a lost civilization, the only remnant being a magical scarf gifted to you by a glowing glyph. As a grand spirit guides you to the mount, you learn you're the only hope at redemption for a civilization that destroyed themselves.

Despite taking only a couple hours to beat, *Journey* won Game of the Year in 2012, and served as the blueprint for Giant Squids future games.

## Giant Squid's Games

### Abzu (2016)

Giant Squid built on the success of *Journey* with the release of [*Abzu*](https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP4040-CUSA03349_00-ABZUGAME00000000) in 2016. *Abzu* follows a similar structure to *Journey* but takes our setting from a vast desert to a vast ocean.

You take control of a nameless diver floating in an endless sea. As you dive down, you come across robust ocean environments, filled with unique and colorful animals and vegetation, but something is ailing them.

An ancient brutalist technology is poisoning the sea and stealing its life energy. Once employed by an ancient civilization, it turned on them and destroyed them entirely. Now, it's up to the player to restore the balance of the ocean and bring life to a dying sea.

### The Pathless (2020)

A dark curse threatens all of existence, its origin being a mysterious island at the edge of the sea where the god-spirits reside. You play as a master archer who has sailed to the island to put an end to it.

During your journey, you uncover the source of the curse: an enigmatic malevolent entity called the Godslayer. His hellfire has been razing the land and corrupting the god-spirits. You journey across the vast island through different plateaus freeing the gods of the curse placed on them, with the ultimate goal of defeating the godslayer in his temple at the volcanic island in the sky.

[*The Pathless*](https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP2470-PPSA01825_00-PATHLESSSIEA0000) djffers greatly from the other games in this list. It is a much longer experience, taking roughly 8 hours to beat, and features a vast open world with many optional puzzles rather than a guided linear experience. This one has a more difficult gameplay loop and traversal system than the others, so be ready for a challenge (albeit still a relaxing one).

### Sword of the Sea (2025)

![Sword of the Sea Cover Art](/images/sword-of-the-sea.png)

[*Sword of the Sea*](https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10011227) is Giant Squid's magnum opus, combining the best elements of all of their previous games into a completely entrancing masterpiece. *Journey*'s rolling dunes, *Abzu*'s robust marine life, and The *Pathless*'s fast-paced traversal system all set on the backdrop of *Tony Hawk's Pro Skater* create a truly unforgettable 3.5 hour experience.

You play as the Wraith, an ancient hero tasked with awakening ocean seeds, bringing life and water back to a desolate, sand-covered world. You ride a hoversword, a hyper-advanced combination of a snowboard, skateboard, and hoverboard, which also gives you the ability to interface with and awaken these ocean seeds. There's a looming threat, however.

The fiery demon of the depths, the one who is presumed to have destroyed the land in the first place, has also awoken, and threatens to destroy the great spireâ€”the only thing that can fully restore the land to its previous magnificence.

*Sword of the Sea* perfectly balances the serentity of *Journey* and *Abzu* with high-energy gameplay (though it is **much** more like *Journey*), making it in my opinion the strongest game of the four. I highly recommend it.

## Final Thoughts

If you're thinking about delving into the world of Giant Squid, here is my recommended playing order and how long it should take to beat them:

1. *Journey*
2. *Abzu*
3. *Sword of the Sea*
4. *The Pathless*

I recommend *The Pathless* last because it is so different from the others. The first three mesh together so well that they're effectively a trilogy and subscribe to the following gameplay loop:

1. You awaken as a mysterious, faceless, and often nameless hero in a desolate land.
2. There is some monument or structure in the distance you have to get to.
3. You go through various levels/stages to get there.
4. You uncover the story of the lost civilization's demise.
5. You discover you're their only lasting legacy and hope at redemption.

**Note:** while *The Pathless* shares many of these characterstics, the gameplay loop is so wildly different and more akin to something like *The Witness* or other open world puzzle games (*Tears of the Kingdom*).

Anyway, that's all. Happy gaming!
